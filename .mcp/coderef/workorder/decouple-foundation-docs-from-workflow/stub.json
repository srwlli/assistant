  "notes": "Current state: CoderefFoundationGenerator runs during create_plan (tool_handlers.py:3530), blocking planning workflow. Proposed: Move generation to coderef-context server, have workflows read existing docs. Benefits: faster planning, decoupled concerns, reusable docs across workflows. Impact: 2 files changed in coderef-workflow, 1 new tool in coderef-context."
