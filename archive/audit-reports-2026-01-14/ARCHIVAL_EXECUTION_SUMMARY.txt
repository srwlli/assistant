SCRIPT DETAILS
================================================================================

Script Name: archive-stubs.py
Location: C:\Users\willh\Desktop\assistant\archive-stubs.py
Size: 14 KB
Lines: 387

Features:
- Automated stub analysis with multiple identification criteria
- Conservative approach with safeguards for active work
- Batch processing with detailed progress reporting
- Comprehensive archival reporting with categorization
- Cross-platform path handling
- Windows-compatible output (no emoji Unicode issues)

Identification Criteria (in order):
1. Test/Example keywords (test, example, stub-location, "testing ")
2. Completed status (completed, done, archived)
3. Obsolete naming patterns (deprecated, remove-, delete-, legacy-, unused-)
4. Duplicate functional areas (multiple similar stubs in same area)
5. Vague exploration stubs (brainstorming/research with no clear scope)
6. Low-priority infrastructure items (category=infra/utility/refactor + medium priority + old)
7. Low-priority + old stubs (medium priority created before cutoff date)

================================================================================
SAFETY & REVERSIBILITY
================================================================================

Conservative Approach:
- All CRITICAL priority stubs preserved (none were candidates)
- All HIGH priority stubs preserved (none were candidates)
- All recent stubs (< 1 week old) preserved
- All active workorder coordination stubs preserved
- Only clear candidates archived

Reversibility:
- All 36 archived stubs remain in coderef/archived/ directory
- Directory structure preserved
- Git history intact
- Can recover any stub by moving back to coderef/working/

Data Integrity:
- No data loss
- No modifications to stub content
- Original stub.json files preserved
- Related files (context.json, etc.) moved with stubs

================================================================================
IMPACT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Before Archival:
- 98 total stubs
- Mixed priorities (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Test scaffolding mixed with features
- Difficult to distinguish active from exploratory work
- Large backlog requiring prioritization

After Archival:
- 62 focused, active stubs
- Reduced context: easier to review and prioritize
- Clear separation: active work vs archived ideas
- Better signal-to-noise ratio for planning
- 37% reduction in stub inventory

Remaining Active Stubs (62):
- All CRITICAL priority work
- All HIGH priority work
- Recent medium-priority items (< 1 week old)
- Core feature implementations
- Active infrastructure improvements
- Orchestrator coordination stubs

================================================================================
USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

To Run Archival (Production):
  cd C:\Users\willh\Desktop\assistant
  python archive-stubs.py

To Review Results:
  1. Check console output for category breakdown
  2. Read coderef/ARCHIVAL_REPORT.txt for detailed list
  3. Verify remaining stubs in coderef/working/

To Recover an Archived Stub:
  Move from C:\Users\willh\Desktop\assistant\coderef\archived\{stub-name}
  Back to C:\Users\willh\Desktop\assistant\coderef\working\{stub-name}

To Modify Criteria:
  Edit archive-stubs.py:
  - Line 119: LOW_PRIORITY_OLD cutoff date (currently 2025-12-20)
  - Line 168: INFRA_UTILITY_LOW age threshold (currently 2026-01-06)
  - Methods: is_test_example(), is_duplicate(), etc.

================================================================================
VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Immediate:
1. Review remaining 62 stubs for prioritization
2. Consider updating projects.md next STUB-ID counter if needed
3. Archive any newly created test/example stubs immediately

Short-term (1-2 weeks):
4. Review active stubs for readiness to implement
5. Update workorder tracking for high-priority items
6. Plan first batch of implementations

Ongoing:
7. Run monthly archival to keep backlog clean
8. Archive test/example stubs immediately after creation
9. Monitor for duplicate feature stubs in same area
10. Keep only 60-70 active stubs in working directory

================================================================================
APPENDIX: ARCHIVAL CRITERIA REFERENCE
================================================================================

1. TEST/EXAMPLE
   Identifies: Validation stubs for workflow testing
   Keywords: test, example, stub-location, "testing ", "verify"
   Rationale: Temporary scaffolding, not production features

2. COMPLETED
   Identifies: Work marked as done
   Status: completed, done, archived
   Rationale: Finished work clutters active backlog

3. OBSOLETE_NAME
   Identifies: Explicitly deprecated work
   Keywords: deprecated, remove-, delete-, legacy-, unused-, stale-
   Rationale: Naming convention indicates superseded approach

4. DUPLICATE
   Identifies: Similar features in same area (lower priority)
   Logic: Multiple stubs with same purpose, keep best, archive redundant
   Rationale: Prevent scattered efforts, consolidate similar work

5. INFRA_UTILITY_LOW
   Identifies: Low-priority infrastructure older than 1 week
   Criteria: Category=(infra/utility/refactor) + Priority=(low/medium) + Age>1w
   Rationale: Not urgent, can revisit if priorities change

6. LOW_PRIORITY_OLD
   Identifies: Old backlog items with low current priority
   Criteria: Priority=(low/medium) + Created before 2025-12-20
   Rationale: 3+ weeks old, low urgency, not currently focused
