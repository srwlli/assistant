# Archive Files Script

The archive script automatically moves files from any project to `assistant/coderef/archived/{project-name}/` by extracting the project name from the file path (assumes format `C:\Users\willh\Desktop\{project-name}\...`). Run `.\archive-files.ps1 "path1" "path2" ...` or `.\archive.bat "path1" "path2" ...` with one or more file paths as arguments—the script will create the appropriate archive directory if it doesn't exist, move each file to `coderef/archived/{detected-project}/`, and display color-coded status messages ([NEW] for new directories, green for successful moves, [ERROR] for failures). Files already in the assistant project are skipped, and the script handles multiple files in a single command, making it ideal for batch archiving documentation or artifacts from target projects back to the orchestrator's centralized archive.
