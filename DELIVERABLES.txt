ARCHIVAL STUBS PROJECT - DELIVERABLES
================================================================================
Date: 2026-01-13
Task: Identify and archive approximately 35 stubs from coderef/working/

================================================================================
PRIMARY DELIVERABLE
================================================================================

[1] archive-stubs.py
    Location: C:\Users\willh\Desktop\assistant\archive-stubs.py
    Size: 14 KB (387 lines)
    Purpose: Automated stub archival identification and batch processing

    Features:
    - Loads all stub.json files from working directory
    - Applies 7 identification criteria to find archival candidates
    - Moves qualifying stubs to archived directory
    - Generates detailed archival report
    - Conservative approach with safeguards for active work

    Criteria:
    1. Test/Example stubs (keywords: test, example, stub-location)
    2. Completed work (status: completed, done, archived)
    3. Obsolete naming (keywords: deprecated, remove-, delete-, legacy-)
    4. Duplicate features (similar stubs in same functional area)
    5. Vague exploration (brainstorming/research with unclear scope)
    6. Infrastructure/utility low priority (old, unprioritized)
    7. Low priority + old (medium priority created > 3 weeks ago)

    Execution:
    cd C:\Users\willh\Desktop\assistant
    python archive-stubs.py

    Results:
    - 98 stubs analyzed
    - 36 stubs identified as archival candidates
    - 36/36 successfully archived
    - 62 active stubs remaining

USAGE GUIDE
================================================================================

Run Archival:
  $ cd C:\Users\willh\Desktop\assistant
  $ python archive-stubs.py

Expected Output:
  [Console Output]
  - Number of stubs loaded (98)
  - Candidates identified (36)
  - Category breakdown
  - Archive progress (36 OK, 0 FAIL)
  - Report location

  [Files Generated]
  - ARCHIVAL_REPORT.txt (detailed list)
  - Console output shows categories

Recover Archived Stub (if needed):
  Move from: C:\Users\willh\Desktop\assistant\coderef\archived\{name}
  To: C:\Users\willh\Desktop\assistant\coderef\working\{name}

Configure Criteria:
  Edit archive-stubs.py lines:
  - 119: Change LOW_PRIORITY_OLD date cutoff
  - 168: Change INFRA_UTILITY_LOW age threshold
  - Modify is_*() methods to adjust detection logic

Schedule Regular Archival:
  # First week of each month
  python archive-stubs.py

================================================================================
SAFETY & REVERSIBILITY
================================================================================

Preserved (Not Archived):
✓ CRITICAL priority stubs
✓ HIGH priority stubs
✓ Recent stubs (< 1 week old) regardless of priority
✓ Active workorder coordination stubs
✓ Project-specific implementations

Reversibility Guarantees:
✓ All archived stubs remain in coderef/archived/
✓ Original stub.json content unchanged
✓ Related files (context.json, etc.) moved with stubs
✓ Git history preserved
✓ No data loss
✓ Can restore any stub by moving back to working/

Data Integrity:
✓ No modifications to stub content
✓ Directory structure preserved
✓ All 36 stubs completely intact
✓ No corruption or partial moves

================================================================================
ARCHIVAL STRATEGY
================================================================================

Conservative Approach:
- Only archived absolutely clear candidates
- Multiple safeguards to prevent losing active work
- Clear criteria applied consistently
- No subjective judgment on important stubs

Criteria Rationale:
1. TEST/EXAMPLE: These are by definition temporary validation stubs
2. COMPLETED: No value keeping finished work in active backlog
3. OBSOLETE_NAME: Naming convention explicitly marks as deprecated
4. DUPLICATE: Consolidation strategy - keep best version only
5. INFRA_UTILITY_LOW: Old infrastructure with no current priority
6. LOW_PRIORITY_OLD: Stale backlog items > 3 weeks old, no urgency

Benefits:
- Cleaner active backlog (62 vs 98 stubs)
- Better signal-to-noise ratio for prioritization
- Easier context switching
- Preserved focus on high-impact work

NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Immediate Actions:
1. Review remaining 62 stubs for prioritization
2. Update projects.md next STUB-ID if needed
3. Plan first batch of high-priority implementations

Short-term (1-2 weeks):
4. Implement high-priority stubs from cleaned backlog
5. Use archival script monthly to keep inventory clean
6. Archive test/example stubs immediately after creation

Long-term:
7. Monitor stub growth and maintain 60-70 active stubs
8. Quarterly review of archived stubs for relevance
9. Consider automation of archival process (scheduled runs)
10. Update processes to prevent test/example stubs in active inventory
