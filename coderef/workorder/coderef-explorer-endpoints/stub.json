  "description": "Wire coderef folders from all projects into dashboard for browsing and exploration. Users can register/unregister projects and explore all coderef contents through unified API endpoints.",
  "category": "feature",
  "priority": "high",
  "context": "User requested a multi-project coderef folder explorer accessible via /coderef-assistant route on html-tools. Instead of building complex MCP wrapper layers, implement a lightweight file explorer: simple HTTP endpoints that serve coderef file contents from registered projects, backend reads filesystem directly, frontend renders content based on file type (markdown to HTML, JSON pretty-print, etc.). Key requirement: users can add/remove projects dynamically and immediately access them through the explorer without configuration changes.",
