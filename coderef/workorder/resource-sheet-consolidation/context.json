  "description": "Consolidate two separate resource sheet systems (Tool 1: create-resource-sheet.md + Tool 2: resource-sheet-catalog.md) into ONE unified system by deleting .md files and routing to existing coderef-docs MCP tool, then enhancing MCP tool with all missing features from both tools",
  "goal": "Single unified resource sheet system with 60-80% auto-fill, all 20 element types supported, 4-gate validation, and 150-300x speedup over manual documentation",
  "requirements": [
    "Delete both .md files (breaking change acceptable on dev branch)",
    "Route /create-resource-sheet to mcp__coderef-docs__generate_resource_sheet",
    "Implement all 20 element type detection patterns",
    "Port Tool 1 writing guidelines to MCP tool",
    "Integrate Tool 2 element-specific checklists",
    "Implement 4-gate validation pipeline",
    "Integrate graph queries for 60-80% auto-fill",
    "Create 4-tier documentation hierarchy",
    "Maintain backward compatibility for slash command interface",
    "Test with 15 P1 batch reference sheets"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [],
  "constraints": [
    "Must work on dev branch",
    "MCP tool already exists in coderef-docs v3.4.0",
    "15 P1 batch reference sheets exist as validation examples",
    "Graph integration requires coderef-context MCP server",
    "Must preserve slash command user experience"
