  "description": "Generate comparative analysis documents across all 7 CodeRef MCP servers by processing existing .coderef/ data to create DEPENDENCIES.md, SHARED-CODE.md, ECOSYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.mmd, REFACTOR-TARGETS.md, and PATTERNS-ANALYSIS.md for v1\u2192v2 refactor planning",
  "goal": "Enable data-driven refactor planning by discovering cross-server dependencies, duplicated code, complexity hotspots, and pattern inconsistencies across the CodeRef ecosystem without manual code reading",
  "requirements": [
    "Process all 7 \u00d7 .coderef/index.json files to extract cross-server imports",
    "Compare function/class names across servers to identify duplicated code (18+ generators)",
    "Aggregate complexity metrics from reports/complexity/ to find refactor targets",
    "Analyze patterns.json files to discover inconsistencies in error handling, logging, and validation",
    "Generate visual ecosystem architecture diagram combining individual server diagrams",
    "Output 6 markdown documents in workorder folder for planning reference"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Refactoring the code itself (analysis only)",
    "Scanning servers (already complete)",
    "Creating new .coderef/ structures",
    "Modifying MCP server code"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Must use existing .coderef/ data only (no source file reading)",
    "All analysis must be automated/scripted for reproducibility",
    "Documents must be markdown for version control and readability",
    "Processing must complete in under 30 minutes total",
    "Must work on Windows file paths"
