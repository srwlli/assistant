  "description": "Add JSON-LD semantic web export capability to coderef ecosystem for publishing codebases to knowledge graphs, enabling cross-repository queries via SPARQL, Wikidata integration, and Schema.org markup for search engine discovery. Supports academic research, AI training data, and external tool consumption.",

    "conversation_summary": "Discussed JSON-LD vs regular JSON usage - JSON-LD enables semantic web (knowledge graphs, Wikidata, RDF triple stores, Schema.org). Currently exports/graph.jsonld exists but unused by internal workflows (100% of workflow-useful outputs already consumed). JSON-LD is for EXTERNAL tools: code search engines, research queries, cross-repo linking, LLM training data.",
    "key_insights": [
      "JSON-LD = data + universal meaning (links to schema.org, Wikidata IDs)",
      "RDF triples enable SPARQL queries across millions of repos",
