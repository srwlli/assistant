  "description": "Improve session communication.json real-time synchronization - update agent statuses, CSV metrics, and aggregation data automatically as phases complete instead of manual orchestrator edits. Enable orchestrator to read agent outputs and sync back to master tracking.",

  "created": "2026-01-18T00:00:00Z",
  "status": "stub",
  "context": {
    "origin_session": "WO-CSV-ECOSYSTEM-SYNC-001",
    "identified_issues": [
      "Agent status fields remain 'not_started' after Phase 1 completion",
      "CSV metrics (total_resources, resource_types) not updated after Phase 2",
      "Aggregation data frozen at Phase 1 counts",
      "Orchestrator updates phase-level tracking but not agent-level or metrics"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Read-only orchestrator pattern - agents execute autonomously, orchestrator synthesizes but doesn't sync findings back to master communication.json",
    "proposed_solution": "Add orchestrator sync workflow: after each phase completion, read agent outputs, extract metrics, update communication.json with actual state"
  },
  "target_improvements": [
    "Auto-update agent status when phase completes",
    "Auto-refresh CSV metrics from actual CSV file",
    "Auto-update aggregation counts based on current phase",
    "Create sync_session_tracking() utility for orchestrator",
    "Add validation: communication.json vs ground truth"
  ]
