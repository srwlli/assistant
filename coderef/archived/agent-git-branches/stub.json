    "problem": "Multiple agents working on same project can conflict. No isolation between agent work.",
    "solution": "Orchestrator creates branch per workorder/agent, agent works in isolation, orchestrator reviews and merges"
  },
  "workflow": [
    "1. Orchestrator delegates workorder to project agent",
    "2. Orchestrator (or agent) creates branch: wo/{workorder-id}",
    "3. Agent works exclusively on that branch",
    "4. Agent commits with WO-ID in commit message",
    "5. Agent marks workorder complete",
    "6. Orchestrator reviews branch diff",
    "7. Orchestrator approves merge to main"
