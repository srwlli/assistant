  "feature_name": "rename-execute-plan-to-align-plan",
  "description": "Rename /execute-plan command to /align-plan to better reflect that it aligns the plan with the todo list for tracking, rather than executing the plan itself",
  "category": "enhancement",
  "priority": "low",
  "created": "2025-12-20",
  "status": "planning",
  "rationale": {
    "current_name": "/execute-plan",
    "problem": "Misleading - sounds like it executes the implementation, but it actually just generates TodoWrite tasks from plan.json",
    "better_name": "/align-plan",
    "why_better": "Clearly indicates alignment between plan.json and todo list for progress tracking"
  },
  "what_it_actually_does": [
    "Reads plan.json from coderef/working/{feature}/",
    "Extracts workorder ID and tasks",
    "Generates TodoWrite task list with 'WO-ID | TASK-ID: Description' format",
    "Enables Lloyd's CLI checklist display",
    "Does NOT execute implementation - just aligns tracking"

    "command_name": "/align-plan \u2192 /execute-plan",
    "tool_name": "execute_plan \u2192 align_plan (or keep execute_plan, just rename command)",

    "aliases": "Could keep /execute-plan as alias for backward compatibility"

    ".claude/commands/execute-plan.md (rename to align-plan.md)",

  ],
  "impact": "Low - just a naming clarity improvement, functionality unchanged",
  "benefits": [
    "Clearer naming: align = sync plan with todo list",
    "Avoids confusion: doesn't sound like it runs implementation",
    "Better UX: users understand what it does"

  "backward_compatibility": "Keep /execute-plan as alias or add deprecation notice",
