# CodeRef Ecosystem

**An AI-powered code intelligence and development orchestration system**

> Transform how you build, understand, and document software with autonomous AI agents backed by deep code analysis.

## What Is It?

**CodeRef** is a complete MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystem that gives AI agents superhuman understanding of your codebase. It combines code analysis, automated planning, expert personas, and intelligent documentation to create a development environment where AI agents can:

- **Understand** your entire codebase in seconds (not hours)
- **Plan** complex features with 10-section implementation roadmaps
- **Implement** code changes with full dependency awareness
- **Test** automatically with impact-based test selection
- **Document** everything from architecture to APIs to user guides

Think of it as giving Claude Code (or any AI agent) the ability to "see" your code like an experienced developer who's worked on your project for years.
